# ExcelConversionApp
The goal of this app is to make a small (but quality) piece of software that will take the desired data out of an excel spreadsheet and create/import it into a new excel file in which ever way the user would like.

This is in a heavy WIP with spuratic and irregular development. This project is ultimately just to help my father speed up the process of going through and sorting information on large amounts of data (by "large" I mean in the tens of thousands, which is relative) and filter out all unrelated or unneeded data and get only what is required.

The end goal is to create a free and diverse piece of software that is optimized and does not require maintenance. It will hopefully be useful to whoever wants to use it. There is a long list of features to be implemented and a longer time until I get to them.

If you made it through my small rant, we may have just became best friends.
